What's this?
===

Doppler is a Heroku client that I wrote about two-and-a-half years ago. It hasn't received much tender loving care since, and it shows. The key thing that is missing from this is Celadon Cedar support.

Check it out in the App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/doppler-for-heroku/id387552592?mt=8

Doppler is released under the Simplified BSD license. Also, although there is nothing explicit I can do to prevent you from republishing this as-is in the App Store, I'd greatly prefer it if you did not. So please don't, ok? :)
